# Japanese Blog

> This blog is still in development

This is a simple blog for recording some Japanese related knowledge.

Currently, this project is focus on how to quickly generate HTML from a japanese sentence, since we think it is important to mark the hiragana and accent.

## Project Structure
Currently we're focusing on testing some features, so there's only one HTML file `main.html` in root. We'll add some scripts in `script` folder. As for CSS style, we'll put them in `style` folder.
